# Orderer Reflection

After completing the orderer assignment 
I've learned a lot about generics, singly linked lists, and object oriented concepts.
The first thing I realized is how important it is to break down the assignment and potential code before I start. I learned from the minesweeper assignment and instead of jumping in I broke down the steps of the assignment
and saw what was given (like the UML diagram and visual) and what was asked of me.
I also reviewed the singly list M06 video in order to get a better understanding of linked lists and how they work.
I think starting with comments to add what you want to code after the methods or statements are made (like what was done in the M07 video) helped me clearly understand what I needed to do and where I had challenges. It was refreshing to see the UML first which allowed me to plan my code accordingly and correctly.
The design of my orderer interface helped define a consistent set of methods which made the project flow better and become much more organized and synced.
I think I made more tests and higher quality tests vs. the last assignment and had them organized well too, having the tilte show exactly what the test was doing and combining certain tests that were similar.
For the strategies of each list, I implement the ArrayImpl where it sorts the list when it switches to removal mode, and for the LinkedImpl it keeps the list sorted constantly by adding the items in order.
I learned a lot about generics in this assignment and how flexible it is for the array and linked list to create an Integer list, a String list, etc. 
I am excited to learn more about generics and OOP, and know that the more practice I get, the more I will understand the tough concepts in Java and OOP that challenge.
